Zihan Zhou #4002456

This project is based on JDK 1.8

To run the executable jar file
1. open SHELL, cd the file directory to the COMP442.jar file
2. place the testing files inside COMP442_jar file
3. type java -jar COMP442.jar in SHELL
4. Enter the full file directory in SHELL

There are test.src, test2.src, and test3.src to make a full review of the grammers because cant really put all those requirements in one single file.
